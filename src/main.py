"""
Main entry point for the API Gateway FastAPI application.

This module initializes and configures the core components of the API Gateway,
including:
- Logging setup.
- Application lifecycle management (startup and shutdown).
- Middleware for request logging, rate limiting, and authentication.
- Router inclusion for internal and proxy endpoints.
- Monitoring and metrics setup.

# ---- Middleware Chain ----
# Middleware is added in the order of execution for incoming requests.
# It is processed in reverse order for outgoing responses.

# 1. Request logging middleware: Applied first to capture and log every request and its metadata.
app.add_middleware(RequestLoggingMiddleware)

# 2. Rate limiting middleware: Protects endpoints from excessive requests.
app.add_middleware(RateLimitMiddleware)

# 3. JWT Auth middleware: Authenticates requests and handles JWT token validation.
app.add_middleware(auth.AuthMiddleware)


# ---- Router Inclusion ----
# Register API endpoints from different modules.

# Register internal-facing endpoints for health checks and metrics.
app.include_router(health.router, prefix="/health", tags=["internal"])
app.include_router(metrics.router, prefix="/metrics", tags=["internal"])

# Register the primary routing/proxy endpoints.
app.include_router(routing.router, prefix="/api", tags=["proxy"])


# ---- Monitoring Setup ----
# Configure monitoring and metrics collection for the application.
monitoring.setup_metrics(app)

# Log startup (outside lifespan, runs on import)
